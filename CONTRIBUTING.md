## How to contribute to QBLib

* Make changes to the `djapify` main source files.

* Before sending a pull request for a feature or bug fix run the project in a local environment for testing. 

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the [codebase](https://github.com/mkrahal/djapify).

* All pull requests should be made to the `master` branch.

## Want to be Collaborator?

There is always room for more collaborators. Be active on resolving github issues / sending pull requests / reviewing code and we will ask you to join.

### Etiquette

Make pull requests for your changes, do not commit directly to master.

All the pull requests must be peer reviewed by other collaborators, so don't merge your request before that. If there is no response feel free to ping a collaborator.

If you are going to add new feature to djapify (not just a bugfix) it should be discussed first with other project members to agree on the details.
